# PairsTrading

This is a fairly straightforward statistical arbitrage trading strategy commonly known as "Pairs Trading". Essentially, my algorithm groups equities in the S&P 500 by industry and identifies intra-sector pairs that are cointegrated. Once we establish that a historical relationship exists between two securities,  my algorithm exploits the notion that, over time, the "spread" between these two stocks will center around a fairly constant mean. When this spread widens too much (in either direction), my program places two equal (in $ terms) trades in opposite directions - it buys the underperforming security and sells the outperforming security. This trading strategy is considered "market neutral" because it is simply making a relative bet on the pair's movement and remains insulated from broader market movements.
